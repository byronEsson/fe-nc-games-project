# Northcoders Games Project

### About this project

This is a project I completed as part of the Northcoders bootcamp. Built using React.js, this application makes requests to the API set up during another project (here are the links to that [repo](https://github.com/byronEsson/be-nc-games-project) and the [API](https://byrons-backend-project.herokuapp.com/))

Northcoders Games is a social games content rating, and discussion website.

Northcoders Games has game reviews which are divided into categories. Each review has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about a review.
